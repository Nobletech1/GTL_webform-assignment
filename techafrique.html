            Kenya has been ranked the second
            leading innovation hub in sub-Saharan
            Africa after South Africa while Mauritius
            came in third, this is according to a
            report by the World Intellectual Property
            Organization.The report attributed Kenya’s
            position to its innovative strengths, especially the access to credit, and microfinance gross loans where it
            ranks 6th in the world.
            Kenya was also lauded for using innovation to
            improve healthcare, especially the public-private
            partnerships
            that have brought immense benefits.

            Fintech companies across the
            continent providing key services in loans,
            savings and payment, have been increasingly
            rewarded with investment and significant
            nods. For instance, global payment giants
            have endorsed Nigerian fintech companies.
            However, fintech momentum in Nigeria,
            Africa’s largest economy, may be slowed
            by proposed regulation by Nigeria’s
            central bank which could make it more
            expensive for local fintech startups
            to operate.

            Africa continues to hold long-term promise for investors and entrepreneurs as the continent is driving
            growth in global internet connections with connection rates now up to 28% —up from 2.1% in 2005.

            Nigeria’s
            large growing population
            will help drive global mobile internet
            growth in the next seven years as, alongside China,
            India, Pakistan and Indonesia,
            Africa’s most populous country will
            account for 50% of the 1.6 billion mobile
            internet users projected to get online by 2025.
